# Needle - Combat Enhancements

## Description

[Needle - Combat Enhancements](https://github.com/Eonzenex/needle-combat-enhancements) aims to add new depth to the combat of Minecraft
without overloading the user with new and unnecessary content.

## Overview

### Smithing
Upgrade your tools to the next tier using blocks or ingots!

### Stamina
Certain new manoeuvres require stamina to perform. Increase your stamina by gaining levels!

### Manoeuvres
#### Dash
Quickly launch yourself a short distance in any direction

#### Bash
Attacking while blocking will perform a bash. Hitting an entity with a bash will knock them back and stun them for a short time!

#### Slam
An advanced move that uses a lot of stamina. While in the air, look down and block. The user will float for a short time to charge momentum, then launch towards the ground.

On hitting the ground, the user will bash every entity in a short range!

### Effects
  * **Stun**: Briefly halt the affected entity in their tracks!
  * **Stun resistance**: Reduce the effects of stun!
  * **Stun immunity**: Completely negate the effects of stun!

All effects are available as potions (WIP)

### Misc
* Hoes now pull entities towards the user
* Axes deal extra damage to shield (WIP)
